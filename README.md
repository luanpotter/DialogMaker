DialogMaker
===========

The Dialog Maker Library allows you to create your Dialogs in two very simple ways: you can both add each field manually (but yet without having to worry with the structure of the form) and also make it automatically – you just select a class and the dialog is created in order to ‘generate’ an object of this class.
